## Sum of 10 Numbers
**Objective**: Write a Python script to read 10 numbers from the input and print their sum using as few variables as possible.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program will receive 10 numbers as input.

**Calculation**
- Calculate the sum of the 10 numbers.
- Use as few variables as possible in your script to achieve this.

**Output**
- Print the sum of the 10 numbers.

**Example**
- For input 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, the output should be 55.

## Smallest Divisor
**Objective**: Write a Python script to find and print the smallest integer divisor greater than 1 for a given integer.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program receives an integer N, where N is not less than 2.

**Calculation**
- Identify the smallest integer divisor of N that is greater than 1.

**Output**
- Print the smallest integer divisor greater than 1.

**Example**
- For input 15, the output should be 3 because 3 is the smallest divisor of 15 greater than 1.
- For input 29, the output should be 29 because 29 is a prime number, and its only divisors are 1 and 29 itself.

## All Squares Less Than or Equal to N
**Objective**: Write a Python script to print all the squares of positive integers that are less than or equal to a given integer N, in ascending order.

## Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program receives an integer N.

**Calculation**
- Compute and print all the squares of positive integers (k^2) where k^2 is less than or equal to N.

**Output**
- Print each square on a new line in ascending order.

**Example**
- For input 20, the output should be: 1,4,9,16

## Greatest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to X
**Objective**: Write a Python script to find the greatest integer n such that 2^n is less than or equal to a given integer X. Print both the exponent n and the value of 2^n.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program receives an integer X.
** Calculation**
- Determine the greatest integer n for which 2^n is less than or equal to X.
- Compute the value of 2^n.

**Output**
- Print the exponent n.
- Print the result of the expression 2^n.

**Example**
- For input 20, the output should be: 4, 16
- For input 50, the output should be: 5,32
